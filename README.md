#Ideas
- Scandinavian Viking Warrior - American Ninja Warrior spoof.  Run an obstacle course trying to complete it before running out of power.
- Hot Air Balloon - Travel across the sky in a hot air balloon.  Searching for new power source?  Earth is occupied by feral beasts?  
- Influence diminishes over time - Bidding game or something.  Spend influence and power to do something.  Spend power at the right time to secure victory.
- Base defense with limited power options - Balance building with using power to activate already build things.
- Mechanic on spaceship.  You are the only one awake and must keep the crew in suspended animation for the journey to their new home.
- Mech pilot - Your attacks and damage you take both come out of a shared power total.
- You work in a power plant.  It is exploding.  Run out of it.
- Card based strategy game.  Power lets you do everything: draw cards, play cards, activate abilities.  As the rounds progress, the amount of power you have decreases.
- Robot shutting down.  Find a new power source before it is too late.
- Cross country road trip in your electric car.  Don't run out of power.
- Your smartphone battery is junk, so run from charging station to charging station so you don't have to be phoneless like a caveman.
- Stranded on a damaged spacecraft.  Power is running low.  Manage life support, distress signals, and whatever else.
- Robots launch from a central location and can only move so far before running out of power.  Then the next robot launches and tries to make it farther.  When a robot shuts down it can transform into something to make future travel easier.


# Robots - The player controls a series of small robots that have a limited amount of power that lets them move around before shutting down.  The shut down robots can be used to help future robots travel further.
